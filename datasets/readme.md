This directory includes multimodal and uni-modal dataloaders. The most widely used Concatenation structure is provided as baseline.

We pre-process visual data into RGB frames, and process multilple frames with 2-D network in the way 'VGGsound' does
and process audio information into with fixed size in the way 'Sound of pixels' does
